						<h3>Disappearing oyster reefs</h3>
						<p>
							Humanity, as a species, has had a large negative
							impact on many ecosystems and the lives of many
							other living things on our planet. Our dispersal of
							greenhouse gasses has caused more CO2 than ever to
							dissolve into the oceans, poisoning marine life and
							destroying our beloved sources of wild seafood.<sup
								><a href="#s1">1</a></sup
							>
						</p>
						<p id="4">
							<em>Oysters</em>, in particular, are being harmed by
							acidification due to large amounts of dissolved
							<em>CO2</em>. Carbon dioxide reacts with water to
							create weak <em>carbonic acid</em>, stopping oyster
							larvae from creating their shells and dissolving the
							shells of other shellfish as well.<sup
								><a href="#s3">3</a></sup
							>
							Natural oyster reefs are disappearing fast because
							of ocean pollution, and do not show any signs of
							recovering. America's favorite bivalve mollusk is
							disappearing, and fast.<sup
								><a href="#s3">3</a></sup
							>
						</p>
						<p>
							Many efforts are being made to
							<em>rebuild oyster reefs</em>
							and other communities in American gulfs. We are off
							to a good start, but it's not nearly enough.<sup
								><a href="#s2">2</a></sup
							>
						</p>
						<h3>How oysters can help us</h3>
						<p>
							Oysters as a species are very helpful to the whole
							ocean ecosystem. They <em>clear out pollution</em>,
							<em> protect wildlife</em> by filtering and eating
							parasites and other organisms, and also act as
							<em>protection against coastal erosion</em>.<sup
								><a href="#s2">2</a></sup
							>
							Oysters and other filter feeders are also great CO2
							filterers, acting as carbon sinks when working
							together in giant oyster reefs.<sup
								><a href="#s2">2</a></sup
							>
						</p>
						<h5>Protect wildlife</h5>
						<div>
							Oysters <em>consume parasites</em> that may harm
							fragile fish, plants, and animals, helping
							endangered species grow without having to worry
							about their microscopic predators. They help
							creatures around them flourish and can also act as
							homes for fish who need them.<sup
								><a href="#s2">2</a></sup
							>
						</div>
						<p></p>
						<h5>Pollution removal</h5>
						<div>
							A single oyster can filter up to
							<em>50 gallons of water a day</em> in a suitable
							habitat. Excess nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and other
							harmful chemicals are taken in by oysters and are
							dumped on the sea floor harmlessly. As water clarity
							improves in specific habitats, seagrasses, fish, and
							other animals start coming back, bolstering water
							bodies and <em>rebuilding ecosystems</em>.
							<sup><a href="#s2">2</a></sup>
						</div>
						<p></p>
						<h5>Coastal erosion</h5>
						<div>
							Because oysters tend to stick together, they can
							dampen the force of waves that would otherwise reach
							shores and erode beaches. Where oysters are, coasts
							are being
							<em>protected against rising sea levels</em> and
							precious beach sand is being saved. Groups in the
							Chesapeake Bay and Bangledesh are currently
							installing large concrete barriers for oysters to
							attach to. Alone, these barriers dampen waves as
							well, but oysters
							<em>strengthen their power</em> and have many other
							positive effects as well. Reefs can also grow to
							enormous sizes, building and building to water
							level. If oysters are used for coast protection,
							they will not have to be added upon later on.<sup
								><a href="#s2">2</a></sup
							>
						</div>
						<p></p>
						<h3>In conclusion,</h3>
						<p>
							A lot of other aspects of the ocean are being harmed
							by the <em>abnormally low pH levels</em>. Sea floors
							are being degraded, animals like coral are
							experiencing massive die offs, and almost every
							single organism is experiencing negative changes in
							some way. However, planting filter feeders in large
							coastal cities may be the <em>solution</em> to many
							of our water and beach related climate change
							problems.<sup><a href="#s1">1</a>, </sup
